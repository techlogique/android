Although cookies do identify a user’s device, cookies do not personally identify users.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>My Services use cookies to distinguish you from other users of my App. This helps me to provide you with a good experience when you use My Services and also allows me to improve My Services.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
  <br />

<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Functionality cookies: these cookies recognize when you return to a website or App, enable personalized content and recognize and remember your preferences.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Targeting cookies: These cookies record your visit to a website or App, including the individual pages visited and the links followed.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Generally, the strictly necessary cookies and some performance and functionality cookies only last for expiring when you close an App; the functionality cookies and some targeting and performance cookies may last for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Some of the cookies used by my App may be set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on my behalf. For example, I use Google Analytics to track what users do on the App so I can improve the design and functionality.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Most mobile devices and apps automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your device or app settings to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. Please note, however, that (as with other apps) by blocking or deleting cookies used on the App you may not be able to take full advantage of the Services.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>If you choose to refuse cookies of my Service, you can remove cookies on your device or immediately cease your use of My Service.
